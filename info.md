# Emporia Vue Integration

Adds a new sensor showing power consumption for the last minute, for each power channel. Configured right inside Home Assistant, no manual config file editing required.

After installation, enable the integration in the Home Assistant integration configuration page, then enter the email and password used for the Emporia app.

This project is still a work in progress and may have bugs or missing features. Please make an [issue on github](https://github.com/magico13/ha-emporia-vue/issues) if you encounter any issues!

Note: This project is not associated with or endorsed by Emporia Energy. Also, I do not have the expansion module or any other Emporia devices so I cannot guarantee support for those (PRs welcome!).
